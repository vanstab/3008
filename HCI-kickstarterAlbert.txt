3 Types of people that could take this stream.

For this Psychology degree 3 kinds of users would be someone focusing on a thesis, someone focusing on a project, or someone that transfers in and wants to take either the project or thesis. For all of these users knowing that they will have to chose between a thesis and project is critical. For the thesis writer they will need to know the courses available and their prerequisites for the 1 credit required from a list as well as what is required before taking the thesis course. For the Project pathway they will need to know the requirements for taking the Honours project as well as the requirements for 1 credit from any PSYC 3000 level classes. Lastly the transferring student will need to know what the credits they already have and do not need to retake from the requirements as well as needing to know that they need to eventually pick the thesis or project pathway.
