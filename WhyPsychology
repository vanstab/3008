When a degree has many different courses that you can take, it can make students more confused on their path to get their degree. 
The B.A. honours in psychology has a lot of different classes you can take and a lot of categories to fill. 
It gets more complex when electives start to overlap with each other on which category they fit in to.  The degree also has 
a GPA restriction on some of its higher-level courses. Its common in most 3rd or 4th year classes to have prerequisites on
them however, its quite rare to see GPA restrictions. If a student was unaware of this at the time of registration, 
that can completely mess with their schedule and timeline of graduation. This is why we chose to address the B.A. honours in psychology.
